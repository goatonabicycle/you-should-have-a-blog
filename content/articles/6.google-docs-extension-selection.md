# How to get the selected word in a Google Doc from a Chrome extension

Here's a weirdly specific problem I'm sure you've never come across. 

1) You have a Chrome extension. 
2) Your Chrome extension does stuff with words. 
3) Your Chrome extension gets those words based on what the user double clicks on. 
4) Your Chrome extension should work on regular web pages and on docs.google.com.

1) You need to have your extension added to a list (Add link here)
2) You need to follow the advice given here: (Link to the description page)
3) That comes with some errors though.
4) Now, Google Docs pages should render with more information. 
5) Now you need to get those canvas elements. But here it gets tricky...
