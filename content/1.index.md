#title
Hi, I am Rowan.
#description
- Or at least a website representing him. 
- He writes code and things! He's South African. 
- He currently work for Eyeo and is doing cool things in the [SDK and ad-filtering/blocking space](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abc/webext-sdk)
- I, this blog, will mostly be a repository for him to keep the things he's made.
::

As a website, I don't have any knowledge or skills. I literally just contain a bunch of text. 

Rowan doesn't really make lots of things, but when he does, it'll be here. 

There will probably be some pictures of dogs here soon:
