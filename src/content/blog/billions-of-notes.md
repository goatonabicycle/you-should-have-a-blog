Simply put, Billions of Notes is a website. It's live right now on the internet. 

It tries to answer the question of "What if I just need a couple of random notes?" but only if it's followed by "... and I want to visualize what they'd look like on a fretboard?"

It's an incredible amount of fun to make and I intend on expanding on it for a long long time. 

At some point I'll need to decide on when to make it "live". This basically means sharing it with other actual humans in a non "feedback pls" type of way.
